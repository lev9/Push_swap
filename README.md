# Push_swap

- a Hive Helsinki school algorithm project Push_swap:

- a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.
Goal is to arrange the values in stack a with the help of stack b and a set of allowed moves (*:



- a simple test:

		make && ./push_swap "2 1 3" 


- create a set of random numbers from min to max (negatives :

		ARG=$(printf '%s ' `seq [min] [max] | sort -R`);

- push_swap comes up with a set of instructions to arrange them:

		./push_swap $ARG

- checker will return OK if push_swap's instructions worked:
	
		./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

- check how many moves it takes to arrange the numbers:

		./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG -z

- a little visual:

		./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG -g

- a push_swap tester:

		go to ./tester

		./push_swap_test.sh [amount of test rounds]
		./push_swap_test.sh [amount of test rounds] time  to check speed
		./push_swap_test.sh [amount of test rounds] norm  to check norm
		./push_swap_test.sh [amount of test rounds] time norm  to check speed and norm

*) the moves:

sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).

sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.

pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.

ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time
